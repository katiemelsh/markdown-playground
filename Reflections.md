I think one of the things these labs have helped reinforce is the need to really create solid instructions on how to complete the metadata fields you've selected and what each field defines. For me, defining the functional requirements, users, context, and content were more difficult than creating the documentation on how to complete the metadata fields (although I'm sure I could have given more robust information on how to complete the fields, I tried to strike the balance of just enough information to fill everything out without getting lost in the weeds about how/why you're entering the information). The file I had for Part II was a nice foil to what I did for Part I, in that it did a great job defining the User, Context, and Content for the collection, but has little to no documentation on how to enter the metadata fields/what they mapped to. I think having that as an example of how to complete the functional requirements will be helpful when I create the draft of my MAP.
