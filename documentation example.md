#   **Cusinine that defies Boundaries: Recipe Books beyond the US Context**
  ## **Context**
Given the fact that I am an MLS student tasked with creating a digital library enmeshed in the milieu of an academic institution of higher education. The cuture of an academic library within the context of Indiana University could be the context.  
## **Content**  
This is a collection of five digital recipe books of which one covers Middle Eastern cuisine, one is on Korean cuisine, one is on Japanese cuisine, two are on Spanish cuisine. All of which are written in English.  
## **Users**  
The primary users could potentially be historians looking for commonalities or differences between each style of cuisine to ascertain if each geopoliticality possibly have had cultural exchange historically. Maybe food anthropologists would desire to compare and contrast these texts for reasons aforementioned but also to understand what vegetation generally grows in those different regions and what type of livestock is common through an analysis of the disparate recipes. Secondary users are likely those individuals who wish to cook and consume food that is prepared outside of the American context given that the recipe books all centered on cultural cuisines located outside of the United States. To substantiate the former, each text is written in English which means that a United States or English population is targeted.  
## **Functional Requirments**  

Users will need the ability to browse and search by a selected set of subject categories relevant to the particular collection; this can include terms like multicultural cuisine, Spanish recipe books, Middle Eastern recipe books, Korean recipe books, Japanese recipe books.  
Titles of each text will also prove useful, and a content description may be useful may be useful.  
We could limit the date ranges from 2005-2018 given that this is the temporal span of which each book lives.  
Limit source types to books in digital format.
