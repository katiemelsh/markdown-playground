# **Peer Review**  
What was particularly helpful about this documentation? I will just begin by saying that you did a phenomenal job organizing your MAP: providing step by step directions on how to interact with the Library of Congress catalogue and the texts themselves, and how both relate to each other regarding element sets and metadata. Moreover, I love how you provided content descriptions with images and hyperlinks to support your documentation. There was not much I was confused about; however, I did wonder a lot about punctuation in terms of the format for titles placed in the title field. For instance, for the book Grist, unlike how I just wrote the title, on the cover of the book it is written in all lowercase “grist” and its subtitle is written in all caps, so I was not sure how to format the title in the title field given my confusion regarding the aforestated. Also, how should the title and subtitle be separated? The same exact thing applies to the text “ruffage.” Moreover, as with both books, the author’s name, “abra berens” is written in all lowercase, so I was not sure if I was supposed to capitalize the author’s name which is the norm in conventional writing. I also wondered, as you often referred your peer reviewer to the library of congress for particular elements, about the significance of “invalid ISBNs”. For example, though one book listed its ISBN within the digital form we had access to, through the LOC catalogue the ISBN was listed as an invalid ISBN which was a different number from the one listed in the book. It would probably have helped to explain what an invalid ISBN was and the discrepancy between both sources. I am also curious if you formatted your element set from some standard set or did you create your own or amalgamate it with a standard version and add your own fields. Regardless, I think it was a great way to provide metadata for the types of materials that were assigned for this assignment. If I was grading this, I would consider this A+ work! I must also mention that your MAP helped me understand some of the things and concepts that we had been introduced to recently that I had been confused about.
